Problems 1 to 4 are programmed for input values.

Accepted input values are Positive Numbers, Strings, and Lists when prompted. When inputting strings,
strings without quotations are the only input value excepted for Problem 3.

To run programs, just run python Program#.py and enter input values as an integer or list
