Problem 6. Working with Files:
1) Write a Python program that takes a text file as input and returns the number of words of a
given text file.
2) Write a while loop that prompts users for their name. When they enter their name, print a
greeting to the screen and add a line recording their visit in a file called guest_book.txt. Make
sure each entry appears on a new line in the file.
3) Make two files, cats.txt and dogs.txt. Store at least three cat names in the first file and three
names of dogs in the second file. Write a program that tries to read these files and print the
contents of the file to the screen. Wrap your code in a try-except block to catch the
FileNotFound error and print a friendly message if a file is missing.
